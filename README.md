## Project Description
The Internet is filled with content and articles written by famous and ordinary people. But finding good and
responsible content is becoming very hard. Also, nowadays everything has a website, and a person’s first
impulse after seeing any object/content, is to Google about it. And the results that these users get, is
completely based on Google’s SEO rankings and, because of this there are lot’s of useful articles and
documents, that never come to the surface.
So, the main idea behind this tool is to provide similar alternatives to the documents, that the user has
currently opened, so that they have more options and choices to create the entire document. The similar
documents will be listed on the basis of matched keywords and topics from the document, that the user has
currently opened, or has provided as keywords in the WebApp's interface. This tool can help in the creation of good research papers without plagiarism, and it may
also help content creators to write and create better articles/content.
And this project will be made as Web-App, so that it can be easily integrated with the internet, and users can
access it from anywhere in the world.
